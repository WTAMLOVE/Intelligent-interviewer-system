Single-database configuration for Flask.

If you add or change models (for example we added `role` to `User`), generate a migration:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=manage.py
source venv/bin/activate
flask db migrate -m "add user role"
flask db upgrade
```

If this is the first time, run `flask db init` before `migrate`.
